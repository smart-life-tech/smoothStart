`In this code, I've added the targetSpeed variable to capture the desired speed based on joystick input and the updateMotorSpeed function to gradually adjust the motor speed towards the target speed. This will help achieve smooth acceleration and deceleration, reducing the risk of motor slippage due to sudden speed changes.`

# to upload the code to the arduino board
## 1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
## 2. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
## 3. Go to the git hub repo and download the code. or you can simply copy and paste the code into the Arduino IDE.https://github.com/smart-life-tech/smoothStart/blob/main/src/main.cpp
## 4. Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
## 5. Click the Upload button to upload the code to the Arduino board.
## 6. Wait for the upload process to complete.
## 7. Once the upload is successful, the code will be executed on the Arduino board.
## 8. You can now use the joystick to control the motor speed and observe the changes in the motor's speed.
